The files in this directory are only being used by CMake during the build process in order to
generate the JNI header files. Ideally we would have pulled the jars from a Maven repository, but
this doesn't seem to be supported by CMake. So the JAR files needs to be added manually.

This also means that when updating some dependencies in `build.gradle` we also need to add a cached
version here. These dependencies are all annotated with a description saying the same thing.
